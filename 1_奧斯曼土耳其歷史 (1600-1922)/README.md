This was a course I took at the University of Michigan in the winter of 2022, titled "HISTORY 307 – Ottoman History II." The course examined the historical trajectory of the Ottoman Empire after the Siege of Vienna: how it was shaken by external pressures, attempted reforms in response, and ultimately collapsed. Upon the corpse of the old empire arose a new Republic of Turkey, founded on ethnic nationalism and committed wholesale to Westernization as its guiding ideology.

I dropped this course after three weeks. First, the instructor appeared to be too aggresive; and second, the course only deepened my aversion to Turkey. To borrow the words of the Qing dynasty scholar Xu Jishe, one might say:

> The Turks were originally a base and contemptible people of the Muslim frontier.
They seized the opportunity to rise, multiplied their kind, and amid times of decay and chaos took up arms.
Relying on military force, they gnawed away east and west like silkworms.
Thus famed cities were ruined, cultural foundations scattered, written records lost, and refinement extinguished.
The peoples of three continents were reduced to a state fit only for slaughter,
trapped in lands of filth and customs rank with stench.

Many people dislike Turkey because it destroyed the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire—a Mediterranean Christian empire that had endured since the eighth century and once held firm control over Asia Minor. In the end, however, it declined under repeated waves of foreign invasion and internal power struggles. From the eleventh century onward, Turkic peoples gradually encroached upon Asia Minor, eventually reducing the Eastern Roman Empire to an isolated city-state and finally extinguishing it in 1453.

Cities that had once flourished—Smyrna, Nicomedia, Ephesus, Antioch, and others—fell under Turkic rule. Although the Greeks made attempts in the nineteenth century to recover their ancestral territories, their national strength was too weak, and these efforts ultimately failed.

這是我在2022年冬季在密歇根大學上的課, 課號為「HISTORY 307 - Ottoman History II」, 講述的是維也納圍城戰後奧斯曼帝國的歷史進程: 它遭受衝擊, 奮起改革以及最終崩潰. 在舊帝國的軀體之上, 一個以民族主義為核心, 全盤西化為綱領的新的土耳其共和國誕生了. 這門課我在3週之後就退了, 第一是這個老師疑似有點超雄了, 第二是這門課加深了我對土耳其對反感. 用清人徐繼畲的話說就是: 

> 土耳其本回部賤族, 竄身買諾, 遺種繁滋, 遭時衰亂, 揭竿而起, 恃其兵力, 蠶食東西. 遂使名城墮毀, 典業散亡, 文獻無征, 風流歇絕, 三方之民, 就俎醢之地而困於膻污之俗. 

許多人不喜歡土耳其是因為它滅亡了東羅馬帝國, 這個從前8世紀就一直持續的地中海基督教帝國, 曾經牢牢掌控小亞細亞, 最終在一輪又一輪的外族衝擊和內部權鬥中衰落. 自11世紀後突厥人逐步蠶食小亞細亞, 最終將東羅馬圍困成了一個孤懸的城邦國家, 並在1453年將其滅亡. 曾經輝煌一時的名城如士麥納, 尼克米底亞, 以佛所, 安條克等都被突厥人所統治. 在19世紀後希臘人雖然有過收復原本領土的嘗試, 但是國力太弱, 最終也沒能實現.

> 始知麥秀之感, 非獨殷墟; 黍離之悲, 信哉周室.
